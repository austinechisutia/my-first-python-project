# 🕵️‍♂️ Decoding a Secret Message - Python Project

This Python project is a simple but fun tool that decodes hidden messages from a scrambled or encoded input string. The purpose of the project is to explore string manipulation, basic algorithms, and how messages can be obscured and revealed using Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts input from a text file or command line
- Cleans and normalizes the input
- Decodes hidden messages using a custom logic
- Outputs the decoded message clearly
- Well-structured and easy to understand for beginners

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- String slicing and manipulation
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- File I/O (optional)
- Functions for modular code

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Git (for cloning the project, optional)
